# BetterBags - Achaeology
Plugin module for the World of Warcraft AddOn [BetterBags](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/better-bags) that sorts all Achaeology items into a virtual group.

## World of Warcraft Supported Versions

- Mainline or retail. Currently, that is Dragonflight

## Supported Items
Just like [AdiBags_Hearthstones](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adibags-hearthstones), items are added by WoW expansion to the virtual groups. Items that do not exist because the expansion doesn't support them are not added. The full list can be [viewed online](https://github.com/Myrroddin/betterbags-hearthstones/blob/main/Database.lua) or with any text editor. I suggest [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) which will maintain the readability of Database.lua when reading directly from the AddOn folder.
